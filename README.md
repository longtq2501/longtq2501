## About Me

I'm a third-year CS student who believes the best way to learn is to **build real things**. After 3 years of grinding through fundamentals, I'm channeling that foundation into products that solve real-world problems — and actively looking for my first dev role.

- 🔨 Currently building **Tutor Pro** and **RestaurantOS**
- 📖 Sharing what I learn at [next-spring-skills](https://github.com/longtq2501/next-spring-skills)
- 🎯 Goal: Land a fullstack internship/fresher role in 2026
- 🎨 Hobby: 3D modeling with Blender
